      A yummy and traditional addition to the holiday feast. If you intend to
      make this, the timing has to be juuuuust right. I would suggest preparing
      the mixture the evening before, and having it ready while the roast beef
      is cooking. Originally submitted to ThanksgivingRecipe.com.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>¾ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>¾ cup milk, room temperature</li>
      <li>3 eggs, room temperature</li>
      <li>¾ cup water</li>
      <li>½ cup beef drippings</li>
    </ul>
    <hr />
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Mix flour and salt together until blended. Make a well in the flour, add
        the milk, and whisk until consistent. Beat the eggs into the batter. Add
        water and beat again until the mixture is light and frothy. Set aside
        for an hour (or, if it's the day before, cover in the fridge overnight).
      </li>
      <li>
        If the batter has been refrigerated, allow it to come up to room
        temperature before using. When the roast beef is ready to come out of
        the oven, ready the mixture.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Pour off drippings from roast beef and measure out desired amount (about
        1/2 cup should do). Pour drippings into a 9x12 inch baking dish and
        place into the oven until the drippings sizzle. Pour the batter over the
        drippings and bake for 30 minutes (or until the sides have risen and are
        golden brown). Cut into eight portions and serve immediately.
